> **Note:** This is not original work. It is a code-along tutorial from the [official getting started with Rails guide](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html). Its purpose is to get familiarized with a Rails app. [This project was deployed on Heroku (with the help of their docs)](https://shielded-headland-48595.herokuapp.com/) and as a result, may take a moment to load.

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Deployment instructions
